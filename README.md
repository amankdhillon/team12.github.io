This Buzzfeed-style quiz determines which Blind Box Figurine matches someone based on their answers to 10 questions/preferences. 
A blind box is a type of packaging often used for collectibles, toys, or merchandise where the contents are hidden from the buyer until the box is opened. 
The idea is to create a sense of surprise or mystery for the purchaser. Blind boxes of collectible figurines are especially popular with teenagers and young adults.

Five popular blind box series that we included in our project are Sonny Angel, Smiski, Peach Riot, Hirono, and Mofusand Cat. 
In our repository, the key files are 'index.html', 'quiz.html', and the 5 result pages for each figurine. 
These files implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and link our intro, quiz, and result pages. 
They also save the quiz-taker's name and determine their best-matched Blind Box Series using a scoring system.
